          <article class="thoughts-block"> We ventured down the side of the island to check out Amoudi bay (confident in every step, since we were 100% taking one of those donkeys to get back up), which was beautiful, we were charmed for sure. We ventured to a 'recommended by the driver' type of restaurant. It had no signage, required a fairly hefty walk half way down to the ocean and was the least tourist place... but not in the way people are always saying like 'oh, we found this place ONLY the locals know about', as though we should all be so jealous. No, this was more 'we have made a huge mistake' vibe, paired with mental note-taking for future refs. The Souvlaki was great. The owner had a fondness for mumbling under whisps of breath after every request, at times visibly cracking himself up by his cantankerous wit. Personally, I enjoy the honesty, and took up to conversation. My Granny taught me the power of unrelenting honesty. Take time to acknowledge the strength in those who refrain from curating meaningless pleasantries in a world that demands it (Or else, yelp). In daring to say the thing truly on one's mind, endearment often follows.

          <article class="thoughts-block"> Greeks are forever pronouncing 'jacuzzi' with a 'y' and the 'i' gets dropped entirely, so it comes out 'yacuzz' which I found to be wonderfully cute. Now, I do think there is a certain amount of irony in having a view of the vast and endless ocean sprawling beyond view while simultaneously being completely satisfied with your 1.5 by 2 meter yakuzz, that's for the writing poems part though.</article>
