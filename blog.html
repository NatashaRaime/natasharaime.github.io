    <h4 class="content">If you can't take a good photo in Santorini, you should just throw your camera off a cliff. On an unrelated note- Airport Mishaps. When they inevitably hit (and they will), remember that the airport is no place to abandon your dignity.
      Would you break-up with someone before you ate a sandwhich and made sure it wasn't purely hanger? Probably not. Plus, it usually works out, and when it doesn't just look at each other and shrug-exclaim "adventure?!"</h4>

      <h2 class="title">Adventure?</h2>
      <article class="thoughts-block"> We ventured down the side of the island to check out Amoudi bay (confident in every step, since we were 100% taking one of those donkeys to get back up), which was beautiful, we were charmed for sure. We ventured to a 'recommended by the driver' type of restaurant. It had no signage, required a fairly hefty walk half way down to the ocean and was the least tourist place...
        but not in the way people are always saying like 'oh, we found this place ONLY the locals know about', as though we should all be so jealous. No, this was more 'we have made a huge mistake' vibe, paired with mental note-taking for future refs.
        The owner had a fondness for mumbling under whisps of breath after every request, at times visibly cracking himself up by his cantankerous wit. Personally, I enjoy the honesty, and took up to conversation. My Granny taught me the power of unrelenting honesty. So, as I ate what was possibly the best souvlaki of my life thus far, I contemplated that legacy. Acknowledgement of the strength in those who refrain from curating meaningless pleasantries in a world with high demands (Or else, yelp). In daring to say the thing truly on one's mind, endearment often follows.

          <article class="thoughts-block">Greeks are forever pronouncing 'jacuzzi' with a 'y' and the 'i' gets dropped entirely, so it comes out 'yacuzz' which I found to be wonderfully cute. Now, I do think there is a certain amount of irony in having a view of the vast and endless ocean sprawling beyond view while simultaneously being completely satisfied with your 1.5 by 2 meter yakuzz, that's for the writing poems part. For now, let's not overthink it.</article>
          <article class="thoughts-block"> We all probably have that one summer in Italy that we were obsessed with gelato and ate it everyday for nearly every meal (if you eat it as a meal it counts, dammit!) The heat of Greece brought out this early demon-monster who, it pains me to say, did come back from Barcelona one summer pronouncing it 'Barthelona' to all her friends who had the great courtesy to roll.their.eyes.forever. until I just stopped. </article>
          <article class="thoughts-block"> As we trek up to the ruins, I was faced with the reality of my defeat, but even in the face of gravitational destruction, I could still find delight in phrases fluttering in the air like whisps over an ocean...'Which one is the parthenon?', 'Visited the Acrop'. More prominently, I was full of humility as a result of a fairly agressive hangover at the time. Still, It amused me greatly to witness so many brave,
            brave women wearing heels (and not those terrible kitten heels -- no, no. these were the real deal) and really, I thought- what better way is there except atop a sweaty gentleman (or very handsome woman), venturing up the ruins channeling greek goddess. </article>
